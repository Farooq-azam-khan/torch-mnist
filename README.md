# MNIST 

## Pt. 0 
* get the data -> `fetch_mnist.py`
## Pt. 1
This repo is designed to train a digit classifier on the most basic neural network. 
1. Get the data yourself 
2. Create the model with the correct input shape and output shape 
    * note: no convolution layer 
3. Train the model 
4. optimize the accuracy on the test set 
Training Accuracy:0.97
Testing Accuracy:0.96

## Pt. 2 
1. use a CNN to train the mnist
